# PolyPy

I saw a video about polyrhythms and I want do something like that with Python

- Draw shapes
    - [x] Line animation
    - [] Speed over BPM 
    - [X] N points animation
        - interior angle = (180 * (n-2)) n
        - Xi = Xo + d * cos(i * angle)
        - Yi = Yo + d * sin(i * angle)
    - [] Circle animation
    - [] Glow (blip flags)
- [x] Audio
    - [] Different waves
    - [] ADSR
    - [] Sample
- [] Distance, speed, BPMs
