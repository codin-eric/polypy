# PolyPy

I saw a video about polyrhythms and I want do something like that with Python

- Draw shapes
    - [X] Line animation
    - [X] N points animation
        - interior angle = (180 * (n-2)) n
        - Xi = Xo + d * cos(i * angle)
        - Yi = Yo + d * sin(i * angle)
    - [X] Circle animation
    - [X] Flip Figures (upsidown)
    - [] Speed over BPM X = Xo + d * (BPM/60) * t
    - [] Glow (blip flags)
- [X] Audio
    - [] Different waves
    - [] ADSR
    - [] Sample
- [] Distance, speed, BPMs

- [] Harmonics: (-1)k * (sin(2pi * k * ft)) / 2k - 1 || ft=fundamental frec | k = num of frecs
